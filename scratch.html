                    <li>Nothing in this world is more powerful than an inspiring idea. Phil Knight is the founder of the 100 Billion dollar company "NIKE". As a Stanford graduate in Entrepreneurship, Phil was inspired to make an impact on the world. He wrote a paper as an assignment once that spoke about running shoes. As a runner himself, he noticed that the best shoes were not American shoes, but Japanese shoes. Soon after graduating, Phil went to Kobe Japan and discovered an advanced Japanese running shoe from a company called Onitsuka Tiger. The owner of this company met with Phil and made an agreement allowing Phil to become the first American distributor of this shoe in America. He then began selling as many of these shoes (out of the back of his truck) as possible. Most of the time, he sold at local track meets.</li>

                    <li>Bill Bowerman was a legendary running coach who taught at the University of Oregon. He's responsible for spreading the culture of running to America with his book "Jogging". Not only did he create a market interested in running shoes, he also was an innovator assisting Phil. As an innovator himself, Phil went to Bill asking for ways they could improve the Onitsuka Tiger running shoe. Bill would take a look at the shoe, make notes on how it could improve, and send his notes to the manufacturer in Japan. With each new shipment the shoe was new and improved. Eventually, Phil and Bill both invested money into their company called Blue Ribbon Sports. In 1965 they received $20,000 allowing them to open their first store.</li>

                    <li>One of Bill's best designed shoes is called the Cortex. The top runners in the World used this shoe and the demand for it was increasing. The 1968 Olympics in Mexico further increased people's demand for the superior running shoe at the time. There was trouble in meeting the demand as the Japanese distributor would satisfy his own demand first before worrying about sending shipments to America. Phil realized that all the cards were in his hands and he didn't need to rely on being a simple distributor. Rather, he could open his own store and create his own brand. His distribution contract with Onitsuka Tiger expired in 1972 the same year as the Olympics in Munich.</li>

                    <p>One of Phil's employees recommended calling his new brand NIKE, nicknamed after the Greek goddess of victory. TO create a logo, Phil went to the closest University, Portland State University. There he grabbed a graphic design student and asked her to design him a logo for the grand total of $35. That student designed the swoosh, a symbol which is now dotted around the globe. Once Phil's contract ended in 1972 the NIKE brand took off. Sales went through the roof and by 1989 Nike became the largest sportswear company in the World.</p>
